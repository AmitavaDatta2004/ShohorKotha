## 🎯 The Problem: A Disconnected Civic System:

In many communities, a significant gap exists between citizens and the local authorities responsible for public services. This disconnect creates a cycle of frustration and inefficiency:

-   **🙋‍♀️ For Citizens:** Reporting issues like potholes or broken streetlights is often a cumbersome process with no clear feedback loop. Reports seem to vanish into a black box, leaving residents feeling unheard and disempowered.
-   **🏛️ For Municipalities:** Officials are overwhelmed by disorganized reports from countless channels (phone, email, social media). This makes it nearly impossible to prioritize tasks, allocate resources effectively, and track progress.
-   **📉 The Result:** Delayed resolutions, wasted resources, declining public infrastructure, and an erosion of community trust.

## ✨ Our Solution: The Shohor Kotha Ecosystem:

**Shohor Kotha** is an intelligent, three-sided platform that bridges this gap with a seamless, AI-powered workflow. We provide a tailored experience for each key user—**Citizens**, **Municipal Officials**, and **Field Supervisors**—creating a closed-loop system where issues are reported, managed, and resolved with unprecedented efficiency and transparency.

> Our mission is to build smarter, safer, and more beautiful cities, together. By leveraging cutting-edge **Gemini 2.5 Flash** models and thoughtful user engagement, we empower every individual to become an active agent of change in their community.

## 🔑 Key Features:

### 🤖 The Power of AI & Automation:

Our platform's core is a powerful AI engine that automates and enhances every step of the workflow:

-   **Multimodal Voice Dispatch:** A high-fidelity Twilio gateway powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash** that allows citizens to report issues via natural language calls. It features DTMF PIN code entry for locality locking and multimodal acoustic analysis.
-   **AI-Assisted Reporting:** Citizens submit reports via the web or voice. Our AI analyzes images/audio for severity (1-10), transcribes notes, determines priority, and generates concise titles automatically.
-   **Acoustic Evidence Archival:** Every voice report is permanently archived in Firebase Storage, providing a verifiable "signal record" for transparency and administrative audit.
-   **AI Completion Verification:** When a supervisor submits a resolution, our AI performs a side-by-side analysis, comparing "before" and "after" visual evidence to verify the work meets community standards.
-   **Fraud Guard (Synthetic Detection):** To preserve system integrity, the system automatically detects and flags AI-generated images in completion reports, penalizing misuse through Trust Score logic.

### 🏆 The Gamification & Rewards Engine:

We turn civic duty into a rewarding experience to drive continuous engagement and high-quality participation.

-   **Utility Points (for Citizens):** Earned for submitting valid reports, with more points awarded for higher-severity issues. These can be redeemed for local merchant vouchers.
-   **Efficiency Points (for Supervisors):** Awarded for resolving issues in a timely and effective manner, encouraging high-performance field work.
-   **Trust Score:** A universal reputation metric (0-100%) that rewards verified accuracy and penalizes fraud (e.g., AI images, irrelevant reports), ensuring system-wide integrity.
-   **Dynamic Badges:** Earn protocols like "New Reporter," "Street Guardian," or "Team Player" based on contribution volume and category specialization.

### 🤝 Total Transparency and Collaboration:

-   **Locality-Locked Feed:** A real-time social stream of incidents filtered by PIN code, allowing neighbors to see what's happening in their immediate grid.
-   **Interactive Map (GIS):** A live geospatial map displays all reported issues, color-coded by priority, providing a high-level overview of community health.
-   **Collective Action:** Citizens can "join" existing reports, increasing their community weight and signaling widespread impact to municipal dispatchers.
